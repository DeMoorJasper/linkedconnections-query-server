# Linked connections query server
A performance experiment to see how much difference it would make to have a caching/calculation server in place to calculate routes, fetch lc-data and cache this data.

## About
Based on the (https://github.com/linkedconnections/client.js)[linkedconnections client.js].
Basically doing the same but on the server side, with caching logic in place as well as endpoints for clients to send requests to.
